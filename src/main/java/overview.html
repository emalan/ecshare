Web Application framework used for creating Multi-lingual CMS Wicket Applications.
<p>
<p>
This framework is designed to make it easy to create Content Managed Sites from existing web sites.
Each web-site would have its own layout and style, but would make use of the framework to embed
Content Managed Panels into the site. These Content Managed Panels make it easy to configure and
maintain the Content from the live website. The framework also supplies Admin Pages that allow
users to configure certain aspects of the site.
