Search Engine Optimization in multi-languages

    The home page of the application is mounted on a seperate URL for each language supported by the application.
    This effectively creates multiple landing pages for the application, one in each language. Multi-lingual
    Search Engine optimization can then be done by using the relevant URL for each language appropriately.
    This approach allows one to have one page supporting multiple languages on different URL's, which minimizes
    maintenance on the actual application. The content is managed using the relevant multi-lingual editors supplied
    by the admin application.
